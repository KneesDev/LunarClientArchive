  Lunar Client Archive
</h1>
A website that gives you access to all **Lunar Client launcher** releases.

## How does it work?
All versions are manually added to `@/releases.ts` and listed in the frontend. Files are downloaded directly from the `launcherupdates` endpoint in the **Lunar Client CDN**.

## How can I contribute?
There's many ways to help! Some of them are:
- forking the repository and creating a pull request with changes
- creating an issue about a new version being released or a bug you encountered
- sharing the repository with friends and helping improve the website
